**How do I add custom playlist?**

> 1. Find a playlist you like, eg: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&list=PL634F2B56B8C346A2
> 2. Copy the word after "list=" it's `PL634F2B56B8C346A2` in this case
> 3. Paste it in the prefrence window (NativeYoutube > Settings (Command + , ) > Custom Playlist ID)
